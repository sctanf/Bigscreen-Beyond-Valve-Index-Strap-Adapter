Repo for making an Index strap fit on a Beyond, maybe with working audio.

- Pi Pico DAC - https://github.com/sctanf/picoamp
- Recommended pogo pin is 9.5mm unloaded and 7.5mm loaded, 2.54mm pitch. Or refer to the diagram below. You can cut a 6pin version in half for each side. You can push out the middle pin from the springloaded side, if you prefer.
